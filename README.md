# Qt-and-SFML
Some attempts to combine both libraries, trying to get the best from each one

First at all
----------------
To run these projects, you must have installed 
- VS 2013 (SFML libraries are installed via NuGet packages)
- [Qt 5.7](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development)
- [Qt for application development](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development)
- [Qt Visual Studio 2013 Tools](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/vsaddin/)


The Goals
----------------
I will try to combine this two powerful libraries to create some interfaces. I love making videogames and I've made some of them with pure SFML before.
SFML is as powerful as simple when you're doing drawing stuff, physics, etc, but, when you try to implement your own GUI elements, it becomes a pain in the butt.
On the other and, Qt has plenty of components and layouts, a really nice [documentation site](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/index.html) 
(as well as [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.4.2/)) where you can find the solution to any problem you find.

The Structure
---------------
This is a new born project already, but I'll try to follow some kind of structure to keep things clean and useful.
The first steps of development will be in an [`alpha-branch`](https://github.com/alseether/Qt-and-SFML/tree/alfa-branch).
I assume this branch will be (if it isn't already) quite ugly with most of rubbish files, but when I reach a milestone with useful stuff I will update that to the main branch. I would like this repository to help other junior developers and indiedevs to learn something new and if my work is good enough, use it for their projects.

The Collaborators
--------------
I don't know how do you end up on this site, I don't know where you come from, but if you're a curious person (what I'm sure you are, because that's the only thing that could explain why are you reading this lines) and you want to participate in this project, you're more than welcome. Feel free to mail me, or suggest pull request if you thing I've made things wrong or you can improve what have been done

**Thanks to everyone**
